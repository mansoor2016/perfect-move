# Requirements Document

## Introduction

The Advanced Property Search platform is a web application that enables home buyers and renters to search for properties using sophisticated filters that go beyond basic criteria offered by existing platforms like Rightmove and Zoopla. The system will integrate multiple data sources including property listings, geographic data, environmental data, and transportation information to provide users with a comprehensive search experience based on lifestyle and quality-of-life factors.

## Requirements

### Requirement 1

**User Story:** As a property searcher, I want to search for properties using complex lifestyle-based filters, so that I can find homes that match my specific quality-of-life requirements.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN a user enters search criteria THEN the system SHALL accept filters for proximity to parks, green spaces, train stations, gyms, and other amenities
2. WHEN a user specifies distance requirements THEN the system SHALL support both straight-line distance and walking distance calculations
3. WHEN a user wants to avoid certain areas THEN the system SHALL accept filters for avoiding noise sources like airports and high pollution areas using data aggregated from multiple sources including property listings, map data, pollution data, and transportation data
5. IF a user specifies conflicting filters THEN the system SHALL provide clear feedback about the conflicts

### Requirement 2

**User Story:** As a property searcher, I want to see search results displayed on an interactive map, so that I can visualize property locations in relation to my filter criteria.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN search results are returned THEN the system SHALL display properties as markers on an interactive map
2. WHEN a user clicks on a property marker THEN the system SHALL display property details including how it meets the specified filter criteria
3. WHEN displaying results THEN the system SHALL show relevant contextual information like nearby amenities, transport links, and environmental factors, proximity to nearby relatives' houses, each represented as an alternative layer in the map with the filters displayed using a colour coding scheme
4. WHEN a user zooms or pans the map THEN the system SHALL maintain filter context and update results accordingly

### Requirement 3

**User Story:** As a property searcher, I want to use a simple search interface with intelligent suggestions (taking inspiration from apples spotlight feature), so that I can easily discover and utilize the platform's advanced filtering capabilities.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN a user accesses the platform THEN the system SHALL present a clean interface with a single search bar and map
2. WHEN a user types in the search bar THEN the system SHALL provide intelligent suggestions that demonstrate available filter capabilities
3. WHEN suggestions are displayed THEN the system SHALL include examples like "within 10 minutes walk of a train station" or "near parks and green spaces"
4. WHEN a user selects a suggestion THEN the system SHALL automatically configure the appropriate filters
5. IF a user enters free-form text THEN the system SHALL attempt to parse and convert it into structured filter criteria

### Requirement 4

**User Story:** As a property searcher, I want the system to integrate with existing property listing platforms, so that I can access comprehensive and up-to-date property data.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN the system searches for properties THEN it SHALL retrieve listings from Rightmove and Zoopla APIs or data sources
2. WHEN property data is retrieved THEN the system SHALL normalize and standardize the data format across different sources
3. WHEN displaying property information THEN the system SHALL include standard details like price, bedrooms, bathrooms, and property type
4. WHEN property data is outdated THEN the system SHALL refresh listings within a reasonable timeframe
5. IF a property listing source is unavailable THEN the system SHALL continue to function with available data sources

### Requirement 5

**User Story:** As a property searcher, I want the system to provide accurate environmental and transportation data, so that I can make informed decisions about property locations.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN calculating distances to amenities THEN the system SHALL use accurate geographic data and routing information
2. WHEN displaying pollution information THEN the system SHALL integrate current air quality and noise pollution data
3. WHEN showing transportation options THEN the system SHALL include real-time or scheduled public transport information
4. WHEN identifying green spaces THEN the system SHALL use up-to-date mapping data to locate parks, forests, and recreational areas
5. IF environmental data is unavailable for an area THEN the system SHALL clearly indicate data limitations to the user

### Requirement 6

**User Story:** As a property searcher, I want the system to be responsive and performant, so that I can efficiently search and browse properties without delays.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN a user performs a search THEN the system SHALL return initial results within 3 seconds
2. WHEN loading map data THEN the system SHALL display properties progressively as data becomes available
3. WHEN applying multiple complex filters THEN the system SHALL maintain responsive performance
4. WHEN handling large result sets THEN the system SHALL implement pagination or clustering to maintain performance
5. IF the system experiences high load THEN it SHALL gracefully handle requests without timing out

### Requirement 7

**User Story:** As a property searcher, I want to save and manage my search criteria and favorite properties, so that I can track my property search progress over time, sharing search results and filters should be a first-class feature.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN a user creates a useful search THEN the system SHALL allow saving the search criteria for future use
2. WHEN a user finds interesting properties THEN the system SHALL allow marking properties as favorites
3. WHEN a user returns to the platform THEN the system SHALL provide access to saved searches and favorite properties
4. WHEN saved searches have new matching properties THEN the system SHALL optionally notify the user
